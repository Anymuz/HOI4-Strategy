## About

This is a collection of Markdown files containing strategic insights, tips, and guides for Hearts of Iron IV gameplay.

## Guides

- [Fascist Argentina](guide.md)
*By mid‑1941 the *Confederación Fascista* owns the continent, your supply netnetwork is green, the Allies haven’t intervened, and every Argentine soldier holds a fully supplied rifle. From there you can try an early falklands conflict, take on the USA, help Germany win WWII, or whatever evil alternative reality you wish to create **Disclaimer: The author of this repo and guide does not support the fascist takeover of governments for the purpose of continental conquest by war, this is strictly for historical gameplay and fun***

## Contributing

Feel free to add new guides or improve existing ones by creating new `.md` files or editing existing ones. They must follow the structural layout and format of existing guides.



**NOTE**: Pull Requests are welcome but will only be accepted after an in-game verification, and since I dont have time to play video games all day every day this will be done on an ad-hoc first-come-first-serve basis.
