# HOI4 Strategy Guides

This repository contains strategy guides and documentation for Hearts of Iron IV.

## About

This is a collection of Markdown files containing strategic insights, tips, and guides for Hearts of Iron IV gameplay.

Soon there will be a custom chatGPT that you can use on their platform to produce these guides and the finnal response can be copied and pased straight to an `.md` file for your pull request.

## Guides

### Fascist/Axis Paths
- [Fascist Argentina](argentina-fascism.md)
*By mid‑1941 the *Confederación Fascista* owns the continent, your supply netnetwork is green, the Allies haven’t intervened, and every Argentine soldier holds a fully supplied rifle. From there you can try an early falklands conflict, take on the USA, help Germany win WWII, or whatever evil alternative reality you wish to create*

**Disclaimer: The author of this repo does not support the fascist takeover of governments for the purpose of continental conquest by war, this is strictly for historical gameplay and fun**

### Communist/Commitern Paths

**Disclaimer: The author of this repo does not support the international spread of marxist ideaology via civil wars and global conflicts, this is strictly for historical gameplay and fun**

### Democratic/Allied Paths

**Disclaimer: The author of this repo does not support democratic globalist interventional invasions for the purpose of 'liberation' and preservation of imperialist agenda, this is strictly for historical gameplay and fun**

### Non-Aligned/Independen paths

**Disclaimer: The author of this repo does not support rogue nations using subversive espionage and warfare to suit a specific cultural agenda, this is strictly for historical gameplay and fun**

## Disclaimer
War is not fun, but Hearts of Iron 4 is. Highest respects go to the veterans of conflicts both past and present, and historical tragedies and their real-world impact on human lives should always be remembered as to never be repeated again. The works stored in this repo are not to be glamorisations of war and at the time of it's creation there are several on-going conflicts all over the world.

Therefore this project will remain non-profit however if content creators such as youtubers or sreamers wish to make gameplay content on following these guides, please credit either myself or the author of any contributing guides.

I also want to stress that this content is for a game developed and owned by paradox interactive whom I am not affiliated with in any way, this content is **unofficial**.

## Support the Project
This repo can be seen as a standalone community project for game players to share and use strategies and walkthroughs use when playing the game. It also serves as a knowledge base for use in various other projects involving AI-driven content.

I do not take donations for this specific repo, instead anyone wishing to donate should use that money and donate to a charity that will help veterans and/or refugees of conflict instead of offering a donation to me.

## Contributing

Feel free to add new guides or improve existing ones by creating new `.md` files and making a pull request to commit. They must follow the structural layout and format of existing guides and be accurate to the game version, DLCs and Mods they are made for.

**NOTE**: Pull Requests are welcome but will only be accepted after an in-game play testing, and since I dont have time to play video games all day every day this will be done on an ad-hoc first-come-first-serve basis. However if you wish to make use of the custom GPT to generate guides and then use the yml script from this repo to produce a gameplay checklist then you may fork as you please.
